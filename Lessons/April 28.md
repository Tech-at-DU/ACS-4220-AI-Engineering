## WARM UP

### Activity 1: 20m Project Brainstorm + Share Potential Projects

Use https://github.com/NirDiamant/GenAI_Agents as well as the topics discussed during the course to come up with at least three capstone project ideas.

Be ready to share!

## LESSON 10: The human art of writing

### (20m) Activity 2: Perplexity Pages

A number of online services claim to be able to spare their users from the tedious work of research and writing. Perplexity.ai's Pages, for example, asks a user to answer a few prompts and then writes extensive online reports and web pages. [In their words](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/faq/what-is-perplexity-pages), "*Perplexity Pages is the easiest way to create beautifully designed, comprehensive articles on any topic. With Pages, you donâ€™t have to be an expert writer to create high quality content.*"

As a class, select a topic and create a report or webpage [using Pages](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/new). (You'll need to create a free account.) 

**Ask: what is good about the output? What is lacking? Is this a good substitute for content created by knowledgeable humans writers? When people can easily create detailed web pages (and collect ad revenue) by answering a few simple questions, what happens to the quality of content on the web?**

## LESSON 11: Transforming education?

### (20m) Activity 3: AI Detection

**AI detection.** In an effort to stop students from using AI to write their papers and essays, some teachers are turning to AI detection software.

**Ask them to research the current state of the art in AI detection.** What false positive and false negative rates do these AI detector companies claim to achieve? 

**Talk about whether these are acceptable when accusing a student of cheating.** 

What test sets are these rates demonstrated on? 

Is the software likely to perform as well in the field? Why or why not?
